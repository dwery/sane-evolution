If, and only if, a frontend wants to enable 1.1 features
in a backend, it will call either [sane_tell_api_level] or [sane_check_api_level].

When in SANE 1.1 mode a frontend should make sure that it behaves
correctly if the backend returns something that was unexpected at
the time of writing, like a new SANE_FRAME type.

You can take the coolscan3 and epson2 backends as an example.
