SANE Evolution is a fork of the SANE project. It aims to produce an [evolved](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) version of SANE by adding features and small improvements while keeping compatibility.

The fork began in march 2008 . You can read about features and [reasons](Why.md) in the
wiki. A quick description of the new features is [here](NewFeatures.md).

Developers and advanced users are encouraged to test SANE Evolution
right now, using [CompatibleFrontends](CompatibleFrontends.md). We expect to release SANE Evolution
for the general public in mid april.
