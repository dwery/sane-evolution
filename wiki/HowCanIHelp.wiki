#summary How to help SANE Evolution

As an user, you can download the source code and test
that it works with your scanner. You don't need to install
SANE Evolution in order to make the test. See BuildingSane .

If you are an user of SANE, we would really appreciate if
you can check that your scanner still works with SANE Evolution.
The degree of compatibility is very high, but having a positive
report is important for us.

As a developer, you can check our ToDo list and [http://code.google.com/p/sane-evolution/issues/list issues]
and see if there's something you can work on. You can join
our development mailing list and share your opinions. Your
voice will be heard.
