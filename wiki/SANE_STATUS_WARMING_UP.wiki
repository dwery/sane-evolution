#summary Documentation of the SANE_STATUS_WARMING_UP return code
#labels Devel-Frontend

This return code might be used by a backend to inform
any [APIOneOneZero 1.1.0] compliant frontend that the scanner
is warming up. It might be returned by

 * [sane_start]
 * [SANE_ACTION_CHECK_WARM_UP sane_check_warm_up]

A compliant frontend must inform the user of the warming
up condition and retry scanning after a while.

This code must be returned only if the fronted has told
the backend that it supports [APIOneOneZero 1.1.0] via
[sane_tell_api_level] or [sane_check_api_level] .
