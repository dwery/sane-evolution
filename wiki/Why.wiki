#summary What lead to the SANE Evolution branch

SANE development has been quite slow and no consensus could be reached
to develop an improved version. The SANE 2.0 draft is still incomplete
and no-one has committed building code arund it.

Discussion has been long and took years, years in which no code
has been developed toward the target of a newer SANE. In 2008
a light consensus was reached to add new frame types to SANE.

But then again, a few days after, the development was stopped due to no consensus
to further improements.

The only solution left was to fork SANE. SANE Evolution was then born
in march 2008 and aims to produce a better SANE by slightly improving
it over time.
