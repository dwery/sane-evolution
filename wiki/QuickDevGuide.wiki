#summary Quick development reference for 1.1 backend authors

If, and only if, a frontend wants to enable 1.1 features
in a backend, the following procedure SHOULD be used:

{{{
        SANE_Int sane_version;
        sane_init(&sane_version, NULL);

        if (sane_version >= SANE_VERSION(1,1)) {
                SANE_Int level = SANE_API_LEVEL(1,1);
                result = sane_control_option(handle, 0,
                                SANE_ACTION_CHECK_API_LEVEL, &level);
        }
}}}

If the backend returns SANE_STATUS_GOOD to that sane_control_option
call, the frontend knows that the backend correctly handles any
SANE 1.1 feature. The backend will place its compatibility
level in `level` .

When in SANE 1.1 mode a frontend should make sure that it behaves
correctly if the backend returns something that was unexpected at
the time of writing, like a new SANE_FRAME type.

A frontend SHOULD NOT use this procedure to declare 1.0 compatibility
as it would be pretty useless.

You can take the coolscan3 driver as an example.
