 * SANE development has traditionally been quite slow

 * The SANE 2.0 draft is still incomplete and no-one has committed building the core of it

 * No consensus could be reached to develop an improved version

 * SANE people refused adding new features in SANE 1.0

The only solution left was to fork SANE. SANE Evolution was then born
and aims to produce a better SANE by slightly improving it over time.
