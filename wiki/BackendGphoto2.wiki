#summary Scanners supported by the gphoto2 backend

This list is automatically generated. Do not edit.

The long-term plan is to support all the cameras supported by the gphoto2 libraries (currently over 140 models).  However, at this stage, only a handful of cameras are definitely known to work with SANE.  Other cameras will probably work if the native file format is EXIF or JPEG.  Testers welcome!
