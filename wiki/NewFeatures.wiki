== API protection ==

Incompatible features will be developed around a protection framework
that allows existing frontends to work nicely with the new, improved,
1.1 backends. 

Newer frontends can choice to support the 1.1 API and benefit from
the new features we are going to introduce.

== Frame types ==

Newer frame times have been introduced and protected by the API level
framework. [SANE_FRAME_TEXT] has been obsoleted and replaced by
[SANE_FRAME_XML] which will be fully doumented in this wiki.
