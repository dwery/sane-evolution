#summary Deprecated backends
= Introduction =

In SANE Evolution some older backends will be removed,
provided that there is an available replacement. Deprecated
backends will be kept in the repository for a while. Once they
marked Removed they will be removed (d'oh!) .

Users are encouraged to test the replacement driver, if available,
and report both successes and failures.
