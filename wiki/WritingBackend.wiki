 * A backend library is always only one file (libsane-backendname.so). Please do not use multiple libraries e.g. for lower and higher level code. You are, however, encouraged to use multiple source files if appropriate.
 
 *  To add the backend to the existing SANE code, the following must be done at least:
{{{
    - add the backend name to BACKENDS in configure.in (and rerun autogen.sh)
    - add any parts of SANE that are used in the backend in
      backend/Makefile.in. E.g., for the backend "newbackend" that uses
      sanei_usb code:
           libsane-newbackend.la: ../sanei/sanei_usb.lo
      See the lines near the end of Makefile.in for examples.
    - Add the source code files to the backend/ directories. All file names must
      start with the backend name (e.g. newbackend.c, newbackend.h and
      newbackend-usb.c). 
}}}

 * Include sanei_backend.h after the other includes. 
 * Declare the BACKEND_XXX defines as the example:
{{{
#define BACKEND_NAME epson2
#define BACKEND_VERSION "1.1.16"
#define BACKEND_VERSION_MAJOR 1
#define BACKEND_VERSION_MINOR 1
#define BACKEND_VERSION_REVISION 16
#define BACKEND_CONFIG_FILE "epson2.conf"
}}}
 * The version number has no particular meaning.
