#summary Coding guidelines

 Here you get some coding guidelines, in particular those that
 have changed since SANE 1.0 . Please refer to WritingBackend
 for the complete specs.

 * Indentation should be kept using the indent utility with the following options:
{{{
-i8 --no-space-after-function-call-names --braces-on-if-line --cuddle-else \
--honour-newlines --case-brace-indentation0
}}}

 You can place them in ~/.indent.pro

 * Do not use a plethora of #ifdef like in sanei/sanei_scsi.c
 * Handle default condition appropriately in switch statements
 * Linking against a single backend is deprecated. The dll layer should be used as it can provide support for further improvements to SANE
 * Use C99
 * Do not use alloca()
 * Use #include "xxx.h" instead of #include "../include/xxx.h"
 * Use __sane_unused__ to mark unused variables
