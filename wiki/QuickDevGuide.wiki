*If* a frontend wants to enable SANE Evolution features
in a backend, it will either call [sane_tell_api_level] or [sane_check_api_level].

After that, the frontend can use the [APIHelpers] to
access SANE Evolution features.

When in evolved mode, a frontend should make sure that it behaves
correctly if the backend returns something that was unexpected at
the time of writing, like a new SANE_FRAME type.

You can take the coolscan3 and epson2 backends as an example.
