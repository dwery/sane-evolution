As of Jan 2009 no release happened. SANE Evolution works nicely, it has
a number of interesteing features but it's hard to maintain.

I tried to address too many problems of SANE all at once. Meanwhile, SANE
introducted some of the things we have been missing, even if they are not yet used
within SANE itself, like the types for infrared data.

There's too much work for a man alone. 

So my plans are to start it again from scratch, keeping the distance
from SANE at a minimum by fixing SANE drivers within SANE itself, if possible.

It's not going to happen soon anyway, I've been quite busy lately.

Any help will be appreciated.
